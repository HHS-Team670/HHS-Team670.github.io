## Github
Github is a developer platform used to create, manage, and share code. There are a couple of steps needed to install Github Desktop or Git.

### Installing Git
Git is a command-line tool that will be used to manage the code. Command line is essentially a text-based user interface to the computer. The command line is a blank line and cursor on the screen, allowing the user to type in instructions such as opening folders and files and downloading packages.

Instructions for downloading Git are located [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). Scroll down to the section with instructions for your operating system. Installation may require usage of a command line.

### Installing Github Desktop
Github Desktop is the graphical interface for Git. If youâ€™ve already installed Github Desktop on your laptop for a previous project or have Git installed, you can skip this step if you would like.
 
1. Visit [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and sign up for an account
2. Visit [https://desktop.github.com/download/](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
3. Download the application appropriate for your operating system and the latest version (this is often the recommended one).
4. Open the downloaded file and follow instructions
5. Sign in on Github Desktop
