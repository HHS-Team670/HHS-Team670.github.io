## What is FRC?

FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a robotics competition where each year, there is a prompt that introduces a new game, with different ways to score points. Competitors have to create a robot that hopefully can score as many points as possible for that prompt in order to win.
	
For example, the 2024 prompt, a game called [Crescendo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9keeDyFxzY4), involved scoring notes (foam rings) into an amp (lower target) and a speaker (higher target) to gain points. At the end of the game, robots had to hang from a stage to score bonus points. 

## Parts of an FRC Match
A FRC match is made of several parts.
* Autonomous Period – When the robot operates without input from drive team
* Teleoperated Period – The time when the drive team remotely controls the robots.
